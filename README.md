# Note Taker

## Description

For this assignment I modified starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. The application's front end was already created and my job was to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
